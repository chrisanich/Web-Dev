<!-- Footer -->
<!--This is the footer or the bottom of the page. It is the same in each of the websites. It is very similar to the Menu bar, but it contains different
elements, like the brand of the Record Label (it is not a link), the links to Rêve Discos social media and the Policy website. All this links are opened in
different windows not to interfere in the experience of the user while navigating on the website. It is important to hightlight that the classes navbar
and navbar__container are the same of the menu to use the same CSS file and keep the style of the site.
If you have a company of any kind, you need to give the user the option of navigating other sources of information,
especially in the art field, where social media is everything-->
